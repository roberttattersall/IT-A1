	<h3>Personal Information</h3>
	<p>Hello to whoever reading. I’m a first-year bachelor of IT student at RMIT, born and currently living 
	in Frankston, Victoria. I went to Elisabeth Murdoch College, and graduated in 2019, where I was 
	interested in subjects such as English, PE and obviously IT. The focus in our IT curriculum was 
	informatics, so I have an affinity for database design and usage. I enjoy working out, listening to new 
	music and travelling. No, I am not related to Tattslotto, but would certainly like to be because those 
	fellas are loaded.</p>
	
	<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
	<p>I am interested in IT because it is a field that is constantly evolving and changing and never stagnant 
	and is now such an integral part of society and our daily lives that it is difficult to ignore. I have 
	always been the type of person to try to understand how things work, so the almost limitless scope and 
	application of technology and its future fascinates me. I want to understand and use technology to 
	help improve society and those less fortunate, whether that be directly with new technology, or using 
	technology to enable people and organisations logistically.
	My main interest in IT started around my early teens when I got my first PC, struggling to understand 
	why some of my games did not work or why movies would not play. As a big fan of sci-fi, movies 
	like Interstellar and Ghost in the Shell further piqued my interest. After doing Information 
	Technology as a subject in high school and seeing on the internet the amazing feats being done with 
	emerging technology like Boston Dynamics robots and Tesla self-driving cars, my decision to pursue 
	an IT related career were solidified.
	RMIT seemed like an obvious choice, well known for its quality STEM courses and industry-based 
	education. I expect to learn industry-specific theory in my major and how to apply the effectively in a 
	workplace, and how to succeed in a tech-based career.</p>

	<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
	<p>An ideal job to me would be one where my skills could help establish and maintain IT infrastructure 
	that helps people to effectively perform their job, such as a Network Architect. Jobs like this are 
	essential to an organisations operation as they aid in the start-up or renewal of non-existent or 
	inefficient communication systems. They are also used to re-evaluate large organisations, and work in 
	small teams.
	This is ideal to me because it would allow me to be flexible in which companies employ me, with the 
	opportunity to do freelance work. 
	Understanding of each business’s specific needs are essential to a successful system, as well as 
	knowledge of relevant hardware and futureproofing. The job requires 5-10 years of experience and a 
	higher education in any IT related streams. Graduates with majors in network design, information 
	system management are highly sought after, with a lot of focus in network modelling and security 
	being ideal. Soft skills are also important, critical thinking and effective communication being 
	paramount in interacting with businesses.
	Currently I have no professional experience in IT, so an entry level position such as a Network 
	Administrator would be an optimal starting point after graduating. To acquire the relevant knowledge, 
	I should major in network design and have several minors related to business, which can be done in 
	my 2nd and 3rd years.</p>

	<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
	<h5>Myers-Briggs Test</h5>
	<img src ="Test1.png" alt ="" style ="height:200px;">
	<p>My personality test revealed me as a “protagonist”, with an even spread of traits and my role and 
	strategy both being related to working with people, being diplomat and people mastery respectively, 
	which relate to understanding and empathising with others. I am a pragmatic and methodical person but 
	enjoy abstract thinking when usable, which I believe explains the evenly spread personality traits. 
	I consider myself a compassionate person and try my best to understand and work with others to the best
	of my ability, so I consider the diplomat and people mastery to be accurate.</p>

	<h5>Learning Styles Quiz</h5>
	<img src ="Test2.png" alt ="" style ="height:200px;">
	<p>This quiz places me between 3 different learning styles: reflector, theorist, and pragmatist. This test was not very helpful. The result could be due to me not being very aware of my own learning style and not being able to answer the questions with full understanding of myself. However, it does reveal that I am not an activist style, which are described as having a tendency of acting first considering the consequences later. I can agree with this sentiment, as I like to have decisions made and executed with logic and order with a clear goal and plan.</p>

	<h5>Big Five Personality Test</h5>	
	<img src ="Test3.png" alt ="" style ="height:200px;">
	<p>The last quiz describes me as an introvert, with my agreeableness and conscientiousness being scored high, with intellect and imagination being my highest factor. I agree with my extroversion factor being lower here, perhaps not to the magnitude displayed, however.</p>
	
	<p>These tests reveal to me that I am largely spread over several different qualities, with no standout styles of thinking and learning being favoured, and that I am not highly open minded. I interpret not being open minded as not trying new things as often as I could, which I can agree with. 
	A takeaway could be to try new learning styles and be more creative in my approach to some problems. In a team situation, these results tell me that I have the mentality to be able to understand and cooperate effectively with others in a team, and I would like myself to be open to others and feel they can trust me to voice new ideas or concerns.
	When forming a team I should take great effort to be approachable and take effort to create an environment where people feel secure to discuss ideas, and I should try to make communication as clear as possible.</p>
	
	<h3>Project Idea</h3>
	
	<h5>Overview:</h5>
	<p>The project idea is a website that helps users find popular movies that they would enjoy that helps them catch up on pop culture icons that they might not necessarily have watched before. It would give new users a personality test, to help define their certain tastes and help make the selected movie more enjoyable. They would have the option to save their results for future visits to speed the process up. After the personality test, movies would be recommended based on a person’s age, gender, and tastes. After choosing a movie, they would then be directed to streaming sites that have that movie.</p>
	
	<h5>Motivation:</h5>
	<p>With people constantly becoming aware of pop culture and the enormity of options available online, finding a movie to choose to watch almost becomes a chore. Even when a movie is decided on, there is nothing more disappointing that watching a mediocre movie and feeling you have wasted your time. Sometimes you do find a movie or genre that you enjoy but may not know of any movies similar in setting or themes. This is where a personality and history-based movie finding site is a useful tool, enabling users to reduce time and effort finding a movie and streamlining the process.</p>
	
	<h5>Description:</h5>
	<p>The website will be a modern and minimal design, with no extra pop-ups or ads to distract the user. When first entering the website, the home page will display a brief description of the websites purpose, scope, and method of finding movies. This is to brief the users and allow them to fully understand why the website will be asking them questions.
	When prompted with a button reading ‘take your test’ users will be directed to another webpage where they will input information into a survey-like text box that will be used to run the query, which will consist of several questions. Some basic questions like asking for things like gender, age, country, and spoken languages will allow for better recommendation of relevant content for them. For example, an older individual may not have seen Parasite (2019) while a younger user may not have seen 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). Generalisations like this will help the query.
	The second section of the query will ask movie-based questions. These could include questions like:
	“What are movie genres you enjoy?” formatted with tick boxes with various genres, allowing further narrowing of movie choices.
	“How knowledgeable of classic movies would you consider yourself to be?” formatted in a 1-10 scale. This question would allow for popular movies to be blacklisted or whitelisted depending on the magnitude of the answer.
	After an appropriate number of questions have been answered, the website will run a query using the databases of IMDB and rotten tomatoes, and search by various factors such as genre, movie rating, and popularity. This search query will also be influenced by the provided information of the user and produce a selection of 2-3 movies. This will be displayed on a third webpage for the user, with information about each title like the cover photo, brief description, genre, language, age rating, etc. This metadata could be provided by movie database or streaming website.
	The page will also display which streaming sites have the movie available to watch in their catalogue and would provide hyperlinks to said websites to reduce the friction of finding the streaming sites.
	Also at the third webpage, users would be prompted with a secondary survey which is intended to collect information based on if the query was accurate and/or satisfactory. This information would then be used to modify or change certain aspects query or UI to allow for a greater user experience for future users.
	Saving the users data is also a possibility, as it allows them to maintain their answers from a previous visit and reduce the time they would need to spend on the site. This could be accomplished by using cookies or by creating an account on the website, and would be entirely optional.</p>
	
	<h5>Tools and Technologies:</h5>
	<p>Access to the internet and a working PC are obvious requirements. For the website software such as HTM5up could be used to create the structure of the website. During the development stage, GitHub seems like an obvious choice to allow for safe back-ups and different iterations of the website. For the movie metadata and streaming information, hyperlinks will be required to allow users to navigate to different streaming sites and to display information about movies. When implementing the ability to save previous user information, cookies are a simple way to reduce the workload of my computer or database to handle user’s data.</p>
	
	<h5>Skills Required:</h5>
	<p>Skills needed for the creation of the website structure would be the ability to code in HTML and CSS.
	Implementing hyperlinks and metadata to a webpage will also be required. For the query, knowledge of relevant questions and phrasing are necessary to making sure the query is accurate and clear to any user taking it.</p>
	
	<h5>Outcome:</h5>
	<p>At the end of development, there will be a fully functioning webpage that can direct users to popular movies on their respective website. Users will no longer have to spend time browsing pointlessly for undesirable movies, and it will streamline their process to one website. It will also make sure their choices are interesting to them and feel satisfied with the movie and product.</p>
